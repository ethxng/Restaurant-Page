# Restaurant-Page
In this project, I will be creating a very simply layout of a restaurant page. The purpose of this project is to get familiar with a new technology: webpack. I will also be incorporating HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I have been consistently trying to plan out everything before I code, and it has proven to be a huge benefits. 
After this project, I get to know how to use webpack a little bit better. Basically, it builds a dependecies graph from my entry point in the webpack.config.js file and then bundle my code together in one file. Then the compiler reads that file to construct my HTML page.
